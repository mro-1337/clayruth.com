NEW! </font><font size="4"><a href="./download32.html">Clay's Utilities for Win32, 
Version 1.0 Beta 6</a> </font><font size="3">dated January 17, 2005 </font>(a 505K ZIP file download)<br>
See the included <a href="./readme32.txt">ReadMe32.txt</a> file for descriptions of these
utilities. Many are 32-bit, long-name-compatible versions of my previously released
MS-DOS batch utilities, whereas others are unique to the Win32
environment, such as timed message pop-ups and simple dialog
boxes that you control from your batch script! A new Delayed Startup utility 
allows you to delay the launch of selected Startup programs; see
<a href="./readme32.txt">ReadMe32.txt</a> for details.</p>

<p>NOTE: Beta 6 upgrades Yank32, Xchang32, and Seek32 to eliminate a compiler 
bug that affected command line parsing when the path to the utility contains a 
blank space; also, these three utilities no longer attempt to read directories 
as files. Previous Beta levels have added several new utilities, as detailed in
<a href="./readme32.txt">ReadMe32.txt</a>.</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>UPDATES: </strong></font><font color="#000000" size="3">The patch files listed below are NOT
cumulative. To obtain all of the utilities in their latest
versions, you need the baseline Version 1.3 package plus each of
the patches. I'll release a full package update whenever the
quantity of patches becomes sufficient to justify it.</font></p>

<p><a href="./cutpk13b.zip"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Patch
1.3b</strong></font></a><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong> </strong></font><font color="#000000" size="3">dated April 2, 2001 (a 24K ZIP file
download)<br>
This patch includes <strong>INIMOD 2.3</strong>, which has been
modified to handle lengthy existing settings without leaving
behind line fragments (maximum existing line length increased
from 253 to 8189 characters), and <strong>INIREAD 3.2</strong>,
which also has had its setting handling limits increased, from
127 characters to 3711 characters.</font></p>

<p><a href="./cutpk13a.zip"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Patch
1.3a</strong></font></a><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong> </strong></font><font color="#000000" size="3">dated November 11, 2000 (a 25K ZIP file
download)<br>
This patch includes <strong>FILEDATA 2.3</strong>, in which a bug
affecting the use of a target file list has been fixed, and <strong>XCHANGE
3.1</strong>, which now accepts an optional "/s" switch
directing it to use simple strings (i.e., not to interpret the
carat and comma characters as special).</font></p>

<p><b>Summary of Changes Included in the Version 1.3 Package:</b><br>
<strong>RENDATE 1.0</strong> - New utility to rename files with
names that reflect dates (per their time stamps, current date, or
any specified date).<br>
<strong>FTIMECMP 1.0</strong> - New utility to compare two files'
time stamps, returning an errorlevel code to indicate how much
newer is one file compared to the other in your specified units.<br>
<strong>REDATE 1.0</strong> - New utility to redate files
intuitively (no silly switches!) Assumes U.S. date format.<br>
<a href="./claysutl.html#Fileinfo"><strong>FILEINFO 2.2</strong></a><strong> </strong>and
<a href="./claysutl.html#Filedata"><strong>FILEDATA 2.2</strong></a> - Improved
the EXE header interpretation logic to avoid searching in vain
for resources in those rare WinEXE files that have no resources
at all. Added recognition of VxD files (.VXD, .386). Major
performance improvement due to new search strategy that uses data
in the Windows EXE header to rapidly and reliably locate the
version info instead of doing a blind search. No false hits! The
module's 16-bit or 32-bit status is always reported regardless of
whether additional info is available. Fixed bug that affected
primarily WinNT and OS/2 command prompt environments, in which
some files that can be seen in the directory are not accessible
to the user. The inaccessible file data was causing the next
file's record to be appended to the inaccessible file's record
instead of starting a new record. This now works correctly.<br>
<strong>INTOR 1.0</strong> and<strong> INTAND 1.0</strong> - New
utilities, comparable to <a href="./claysutl.html#IntAdd">INTADD</a>, except
they perform a bitwise OR and bitwise AND, respectively, of the
two arguments.<br>
<strong>SYSSAVE 1.0</strong> - New utility to back up the FAT16 C:
drive's critical system areas (boot record, FATs and root
directory) as an aid to disaster recovery. Companion SYSBACK
batch script uses SYSSAVE in combination with FILEAGE to perform
periodic backups at any desired interval and with 1 to 35 levels
of redundancy. FOR USE ON FAT16 C: DRIVE ONLY!<br>
<strong>EXCL_OR 1.0</strong> - New utility to encode/decode files
with a simple Exclusive-OR algorithm. This is for protection from
casual snoopers only; it is not very secure.<br>
<a href="./claysutl.html#LongAdd"><strong>LONGADD 1.0</strong></a> - New utility
to add long integers (+ or - 2 gig).</p>

<p>Below is a brief summary, in no particular order, of each
utility. For more detailed information, <a href="./download.html">download
the package</a> and view the README.TXT, README1.TXT, and README2.TXT
files. Additional utilities, newly added, are briefly described
in the <a href="./claysutl.html#PageTop">Summary of Changes</a> at the top of
this page.</p>

<p><a name="Tsr"></a><b>TSR.COM</b> - This is a dummy TSR that
does nothing but consume DOS memory (conventional or upper). Use
it to test the minimum memory requirement for running any DOS
program of interest. Command line parameters allow you to
specifiy the exact amount of memory to consume, from 192 bytes to
just under 64K. To consume more than 64K, load multiple instances
of this TSR. The last loaded instance can be adjusted in size
after loading to fine-tune the remaining free memory. </p>

<p><b>ISRUN.COM</b> - This utility reports whether a specified
program is loaded in DOS memory and, when found, displays the
addresses of its code (PSP) and environment data segments. It
reports both TSRs and device drivers. An errorlevel code returns
a logical flag to your batch script; this is most useful for
determining whether your batch script is running under another
process, such as a network LOGIN program, the RUNBAT$ utility,
etc. </p>

<p><a name="Fileinfo"></a><b>FILEINFO.EXE</b> - This DOS-based
utility locates and displays official Windows File Information
from any program module adhering to the "StringFileInfo"
resource standard. The "File Version" returned in the
FILEINFO report is the best authority as to which copy of a DLL
file is actually the most up-to-date, regardless of what the date/time
stamps say. Software vendors often redate the files included in
their packages to reflect the date of package issue, causing
obsolete DLLs to appear newer than they really are. FILEINFO can
help set things straight. </p>

<p><a name="Filedata"></a><b>FILEDATA.EXE</b> - This variant of <a href="./claysutl.html#Fileinfo">FILEINFO</a> produces its output in Comma
Separated Values (CSV) format, suitable for importing into a
database or spreadsheet. The first record contains field names.
To facilitate the sorting and comparison of DLLs throughout your
computer system, an empty database structure in Microsoft(TM)
Access(TM) format is provided, complete with a "Comparison"
query that sorts the essential information for you. The database
was created in Access 2.0 and can be up-converted to a more
recent format.</p>

<p><a name="Xchange"></a><b>XCHANGE.EXE </b>- Extended global
find-and-replace for any kind of file, of any size. This is
suitable for use at the command prompt or in a batch file. It can
even be used to patch code within an executable file, provided
that the search and replace sequences contain the same quantity
of bytes. All byte values, 0 through 255 (x00 through xFF), are
supported. Lengthy search/replace string specifications can be
placed in a script file, and an ASCII or binary image file can be
used as a replacement (4K maximum script or image size). </p>

<p><a name="xchange30"></a><strong>XCHANGE 3.0</strong>,
available as of package release 1.2, recognizes the ZIP file
format and can change the embedded path strings in such a manner
that the PKZIPFIX utility (provided by <a href="http://www.pkware.com/">PKWare</a> with PKZIP 2.04g) can
clean up the resulting ZIP file directory pointers. This works
only if the first file name in the archive begins with the path
you wish to change. </p>

<p><b>YANK.EXE</b> - This is similar to <a href="./claysutl.html#Xchange">XCHANGE.EXE</a>
with one important exception. Whereas XCHANGE removes/replaces
only the sought text, YANK removes/replaces the <b>entire line</b>
that contains the sought text. It "yanks" out the whole
line, including the CR/LF at the end, substituting the
replacement text string (or image file contents). </p>

<p><b>LINEMOD.EXE</b> - Another variation on <a href="./claysutl.html#Xchange">XCHANGE</a>,
LINEMOD changes only targeted lines, as identified by a unique
identifier string. </p>

<p><b>SEEK.EXE</b> - This handy alternative to the DOS FIND
command is extremely useful to batch programmers who simply want
to find out if something exists in a file. SEEK looks for the
search string and returns an errorlevel code indicating whether
or not it was found. SEEK handles binary files as well as ASCII
files; the search string can contain control characters, graphics
characters, CR/LF sequences, etc. - even nulls. </p>

<p><b>SCANSTR.COM</b> - This program scans a <b>string</b> (not a
file) to determine whether it contains a second specified string.
Primarily useful for screening the content of environment
variables, SCANSTR returns a message and errorlevel code
indicating the relative position of the search string within the
target string. If the search string is not found within the
target string, the return code is zero. A return code of 1
indicates that the search string begins at the first character of
the target string; 2 indicates that it begins at the second
character, etc. </p>

<p><a name="Splitfil"></a><b>SPLITFIL.EXE</b> - Splits any file
into two parts at the first occurrence of a search string (other
than at the very beginning of the file), or at a specified size.
It works with both text and binary files. Split files can be
reassembled later, if necessary, with COPY /B file1+file2 (i.e.,
the binary option of the DOS' built-in COPY command). </p>

<p><a name="Ocopy"></a><b>OCOPY.EXE</b> - Overwrites a specified
target file with a copy of a specified source file. This is a
true overwriting file copier. Unlike COPY, which effectively
deletes any existing file of the target name and re-creates the
file in a new storage area, OCOPY ensures that the new file
overwrites the existing file, using the same storage allocation.
OCOPY copies any file, regardless of S, H, or R attributes, but
does not pass along those attributes. If file2 exists, any "R"
attribute must first be removed; it will be overwritten and its
size and date/time stamp will be adjusted to match file1. If file2
does not exist, it will be created. OCOPY incorporates Novell
Netware functions to make network errors invisible to the user,
and it has the unique ability to copy a file to a directory where
the user has only the Write and Create permissions. Thus, as a
network administrator, you can create a server-based directory
where your login-time batch scripts, running on user PCs, can
deposit data that only you can retrieve; ordinary users won't
even see that any files are there. </p>

<p><b>FILEAGE.EXE</b> - Determines the age of the specified file,
in the specified units, and returns an errorlevel code equal to
the quantity of time units elapsed since the file's modification
date/time stamp. An optional parameter can specify units of
seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years; the
default units are days. The largest valid quantity returned by
errorlevel is 250, but larger values may be displayed (returns
nonfatal errorlevel 251). Errorlevels 252 through 255 are
reserved for fatal errors. Use FILEAGE to schedule events, detect
obsolete files, etc. </p>

<p><b>SRCHDIR.COM</b> - Subdirectory search for specified file(s).
SRCHDIR produces a list of all files matching the file
specification in the base directory (i.e., current working
directory, or other directory shown in the filespec) and all of
its subdirectories. This list differs from that obtained by the
DOS command "DIR filespec /s /b" in two ways: it
includes each file's date/time stamp while omitting the usual DIR
header and trailer, and it lists hidden files as well as normal
files, including any that are in hidden subdirectories. An
optional parameter can omit the subdirectory search. </p>

<p><b>INVORALL.EXE</b> - File Inventory Utility with Multiple
Seeks and Critical Error Trapping. INVORALL is an enhanced
SRCHDIR that returns all file names that include any of the
specified seek strings. In addition to the information returned
by SRCHDIR, the file size (up to 2 GB) is appended to each line,
and extremely long paths are handled gracefully by omitting the
lowest subdirectory levels (substituting "\...\") and
showing only what fits in the space. The maximum number of seek
strings is limited only by the 127-character command line. This
utility employs critical error trapping, so it can be used on a
removable-media drive without triggering unwanted error messages.
</p>

<p><b>MAKEDIR.COM</b> and <b>REMOVDIR.COM</b> - These are non-complaining
substitutes for the DOS "mkdir" or "md"
command, and "rmdir" or "rd" command,
respectively, suitable for use in batch files. MAKEDIR attempts
to create the specified directory. If the directory already
exists, its report of "Cannot create directory dirspec"
is directed to STDOUT where it can be redirected to NUL or to a
log file. Similarly, REMOVDIR attempts to remove the specified
directory, and its report of being unable to do so is
redirectable. </p>

<p><b>DELFILE.COM</b> - Just as REMOVDIR gets rid of directories
in a batch-friendly way, DELFILE gets rid of unwanted files. Its
report, announcing whether or not the file was deleted, is
redirectable. </p>

<p><b>BIN2ASC.EXE</b> and <b>ASC2BIN.EXE</b> - This is a
complementary pair of programs for converting binary files to
ASCII files and back again. Some communication protocols,
designed for use with ASCII files, cannot transfer binary files
due to their interpretation of special characters within the data
stream. BIN2ASC converts a binary file of size x to an ASCII file
of size 2x that contains the hexadecimal ASCII representation of
the binary values found in the original file. ASC2BIN converts
such a file back to its original binary form. This method is not
as space-efficient as UUENCODE, MIME, BinHex, etc., but it has
the advantage of being eye-readable as to the ASCII codes being
transmitted. </p>

<p><a name="IntAdd"></a><b>INTADD.COM</b> - Integer Addition
program suitable for use with decimal or hexadecimal values. The
output is a "SET RESULT=sum" command printed to stdout,
which can be redirected into a batch file and called to create
the RESULT environment variable. The sum is formatted as either a
four-digit hexadecimal value with leading zeros, or as a non-padded
decimal value. The format of value1 determines the format of the
sum. A leading "x" identifies the value as hexadecimal,
but the output sum will not include an x. The input parameters
are not case-sensitive. Permissible values are hexadecimal 0000
to FFFF or decimal -32768 to 32767. Hexadecimal results of 8000
through FFFF are considered to be "negative". The
returned errorlevel code is 0 for positive result, 1 for
negative, and 2 for syntax error. </p>

<p><a name="LongAdd"></a><b>LONGADD.COM</b> - Long Integer
Addition, similar to INTADD.COM as described above, except that
the range of input and output values is hexadecimal 00000000 to
FFFFFFFF or decimal -2147483648 to 2147483647, where hexadecimal
values 80000000 to FFFFFFFF are considered negative. </p>

<p><b>INPUT.COM</b> - Provides text input within a batch file,
one line of up to 128 characters; user-entered text is appended
to a specified file. </p>

<p><b>TPAUSE.COM</b> - Timed Pause displays a user-specified
prompt and accepts a single-keystroke response. If no key is
pressed within the timeout interval, it terminates with zero
errorlevel. Timeout may be from 1 second to 23 hours 59 minutes
59 seconds, or infinite. Default timeout = 1 minute. Returns
errorlevel code = position of keystroke within character list, 0
= timed out. See (and execute) TPHELP.BAT for usage examples. </p>

<p><b>TZSET.EXE</b> - Automatically sets the TZ environment
variable to either CST6 or CST6CDT, depending on whether or not
the current system date is between the first Sunday in April and
the fourth Sunday in October. The central time zone is only a
default; if you use it in another time zone, simply preset TZ to
the base setting for your time zone (e.g., SET TZ=EST5) before
invoking TZSET. It will then produce either the same setting or
one with the proper "_DT" appended to it (e.g., SET TZ=EST5EDT).
If the current TZ setting is undefined, or if its 2nd through 4th
characters are not "ST" followed by a numeric
character, the default CST zone is used. A confirmational message
of the form ":: Setting TZ=CST6CDT" is issued to STDOUT.
</p>

<p><b>FINDALL.EXE</b> - An alternative to the DOS FIND command.
By using wildcards in the filespec, multiple files may be
searched with a single command, and the output is not dirtied up
with the names of files being checked. </p>

<p><b>LMORE.COM</b> - An alternative to the DOS MORE command. Use
it in identical fashion. Although the DOS MORE command has
improved in recent versions, it is still quite messy, especially
when dealing with lines longer than 80 characters (i.e., lines
that wrap around to display as multiple-line records). It has a
bad habit of printing its "-- More --" prompt in the
middle of a line and thoroughly messing up the display format of
all remaining display lines of the affected record. LMORE is a
line-based MORE that checks the length of each input record to
ensure that it will fit on the current screenful before
displaying it. If the entire record cannot fit on the screen, the
"-- More --" prompt appears in the position that the
first line would occupy. When a key is pressed, it backspaces
over its prompt, overwrites the prompt with spaces, then
backspaces over it again so that the display can continue in
uninterrupted fashion. If the keystroke is Esc or Ctrl-C, the
process is aborted. </p>

<p><b>INIMOD.EXE</b> - This utility allows you to add, delete, or
modify settings within specific sections of Windows-style .INI
files. </p>

<p><b>INIREAD.EXE</b> - This .INI file interpreter for batch
files allows you to capture any desired setting, from any
section, in the environment variable you name. If the parameter
is found in multiple lines of the same section (e.g., "device="
in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI), the first occurrence will
be returned in the specified variable, and the subsequent
occurrences will be returned in variables having similar names
with numerical suffixes 2 through n, where n is the number of
occurrences found. </p>

<p><a name="Runbat$Exe"></a><b>RUNBAT$.EXE</b> - This is a batch
file launcher for use within a user's Novell network login script.
It looks up the COMSPEC environment variable and calls whatever
is referenced therein (i.e., the fully qualified path to the
command line processor), passing it parameters requesting a 5K
space for environment variables (/E:5120) and command execution
(/C) plus whatever parameters (maximum quantity of 9) are
included on the RUNBAT$ command line. </p>

<p><a name="Runbat$Com"></a><b>RUNBAT$.COM</b> - Used in the same
manner described above for <a href="./claysutl.html#Runbat$Exe">RUNBAT$.EXE</a>,
RUNBAT$.COM runs COMMAND.COM as a child process instead of
letting it overlay RUNBAT$.COM in memory. This has an impact of
approximately 15K on the conventional DOS memory available to the
launched batch process. However, this makes it compatible with
Windows 95B and later in addition to remaining compatible with MS-DOS
versions 3.0 through 6.22. </p>

<p><b>ENVMASTR.EXE</b> - When you use the SET command while
shelled out from an application, it sees only the local
environment of the shell. ENVMASTR lets you work in the master
environment that was created when the system was booted, and/or
any subordinate environments. This is especially useful when
using RUNBAT$ to execute a batch whose environment manipulation
is expected to stick to the command environment from which
RUNBAT$ was executed. The batch can either make all environment
changes through ENVMASTR, or make them locally and then use
ENVMASTR to copy the modified environment into the master. A
display-only option lets you view the content of any environment
space, complete with a report of the environment size, bytes used
and bytes free. </p>

<p><b>NRTS.EXE</b> - This is a utility for testing a user's
rights in a specified Novell server volume subdirectory. It works
with Novell Netware 3.11 and MS-DOS 5.0. </p>

<p><b>HIDE.COM</b> and <b>UNHIDE.COM</b> - This is the easy way
to hide and unhide files and directories! Similar capability is
available in DOS 5.0 and higher via the ATTRIB command, but
ATTRIB is awkward to use with all of its parameters, and it
complains when it can't find the file or is restricted by the
status of unspecified attributes. Since HIDE and UNHIDE produce
no display under any conditions, you can use them in your batch
program without regard for whether or not such a file exists or
has various other attributes. </p>

<p><b>SETRO.COM</b> and <b>SETSHR.COM</b> - Like HIDE and UNHIDE,
SETRO and SETSHR provide a quick and easy way to set the Read-Only
attribute (SETRO) or the System, Hidden, and Read-Only attributes
(SETSHR) in your batch files. </p>

<p><b>BIOSVER.COM</b> and <b>VIDVER.COM</b> - These utilities
capture the version identification strings from the system BIOS
ROMs and the VGA ROM extension, respectively. </p>

<p><b>EXTMEM.COM</b> - This utility reads the CMOS to determine
how much extended memory is present on the system. It returns a
string that can be redirected to a log file as part of a system
inventory script. </p>

<p><b>DAYOFWK.COM</b> - Returns an errorlevel code corresponding
to the current day of week, where 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, etc.,
through 7=Saturday. Visual output reports the errorlevel returned
and the day of week (3-character abbreviation); e.g., "3=Tue".
This output may be redirected to a file, NUL, or other device.
Use DAYOFWK in batch files to control processes that should be
performed only on certain days of the week. </p>

<p align="left"><a name="Fixtime"></a><b>FIXTIME.COM</b> - Resets
the DOS clock to match the real-time clock. This is handy when
certain notebook PCs wake up from suspended operation and still
show a DOS time setting from when they were initially suspended.
The real-time clock has continued running, but DOS was asleep and
doesn't know that any time has passed! A simple FIXTIME command
will bring DOS back to reality. This can also be used
periodically on systems that run continuously on an extended
basis, to correct DOS's inherent time drift. Although documented,
version 1.0 of this utility was inadvertently omitted from
package releases 1.0 through 1.2. Version 1.0 fixed only the time
of day; if the PC had been asleep overnight its DOS date would
remain incorrect. Version 2.0 fixes both the date and the time of
day.</p>
